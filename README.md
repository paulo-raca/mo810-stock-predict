Stock Market Prediction

# Goal

Our goal is twofold:
- Predict the stock prices of a company in the future (next day, next week, next year, etc)
- Build an algorithm for semi-automic trading.

# Dataset

The ideal dataset should include, for every publicly-traded company in the world:
- Minute-by-minute values of stock
- Summary of the fundamentals (revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities)
- Analyst's recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc)
- Analysis of the news and associated sentiment.
- Indicators on how it is being influenced by everything else (competitors, politics, economy, etc)

While most of this informations is supposedly public, there is a number of obstacles:

- Detailed datasets on the historical data of stock prices, fundamentals, etc, are widely available, but only for those who pay a very significant fee. [ยน](https://quantquote.com/historical-stock-data)
- Analyst's recommendations are often wrong, in conflict with each other, and not consistently available for every company, which makes them very hard to handle.
- News and sentiment analysis is a really though problem on it's own, and we are not taking the challenge at this time. (There are other groups planning to do related stuff -- Maybe partner with them?)
- Indicators on how the whole world influences one stock is a very, very complex, poorly defined and unstructured problem, and we will make no attempt to handle it.

In face of these obstacles, we will settle for a much-simplified, easily obtained and hopefully good-enough dataset: The daily summaries of US company's performance: Open, Close, Min and Max prices, and amount of transations.

This is large, well-known dataset, with several free sources. Initially, we will use [the one available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs), which is reasonaly up-to-date (November/2017) and goes back several decades. We may switch for an updated dataset later on if it becomes available.

Unfortunately, the lack of real-time pricing will limit our prediction performance on day trading and short-term investments -- which would actually be the best possible scenario for an automatic trader, since a company's fundamentals, world economy, etc doesn't normally change within a day, even though people pay considerably different prices for a company within a day without anything special happening.


# Training considerations

## Special days

There is a really high correlation between the prices of every stock in the planet -- A company goes bankrupt in Japan, and and every US company loses market value in the next day. Therefore, we must be careful not to use the same period for both validation and training. 

Also, day-of-week, day-of-month and holidays also influence the stock market. 

A possible approach would be to pick a random validation weekday for each week.

More difficult and much more importantly, Quarterly Earnings Report, Product launches and scandals all cause major shifts in stock prices, and might need special handling.

## Related Companies

As mentioned before, the values companies influence each other: If traders are in a good mood, virtually every company will be traded a few percent higher than in the previous day. And the other way around too.

But the level of influence of one company on the next changes a lot: 
- When FB privacy scandal broke out, Google was directly affected, but 3M was not.
- When oil prices go up, Tesla stocks go up, but Apple's are unafected.

We could probably use these relationships as part of our algorithm.

There are [many indexes](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/indices/sector-indices.aspx) to cluster companies by sector (Industrial, Transportation, Oil, Technology, etc), and maybe we could even build our own.

# Strategies

## Prediction
There are a few possible strategies to predict the stock values after a timeframe:
- Embed the time series of the company values and any other relevant data in a the feature list and train a normal deep neural network.

- Use Long short-term memory layers structure to train on the time series

## Semi-automatic Trading

Stock trading can be seen as an (expensive/profitable) Game.
We could use the same Reinforcement Learning techniques tipically used to train games to obtain a good trader.

It's inputs are:
- Price history of all the companies being examined
- Amount of shares we currently hold of each company.
- Amount of money (Available and pending -- After a sell it takes 3 days for the money to become available)

The outputs are:
- How many shares to buy of each company (And for how much)
- How many shares to sell of each company (And for how much)

The score of a given state is given by the market value of your account.

After each round (trading day), a new state is calculated performing the buy and sell operations _if the desired prices were reached_. Transaction prices and settling time are applied too.
