# Dataset

The ideal dataset should include, for every publicly-traded company in the world:
- Minute-by-minute values of stock
- Summary of the fundamentals (revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities)
- Analyst's recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc)
- Analysis of the news and associated sentiment.
- Indicators on how it is being influenced by everything else (competitors, politics, economy, etc)

While most of this informations is supposedly public, there is a number of obstacles:

- Detailed datasets on the historical data of stock prices, fundamentals, etc, are widely available, but only for those who pay a very significant fee. [ยน](https://quantquote.com/historical-stock-data)
- Analyst's recommendations are often wrong, in conflict with each other, and not consistently available for every company, which makes them very hard to handle.
- News and sentiment analysis is a really though problem on it's own, and we are not taking the challenge at this time. (There are other groups planning to do related stuff -- Maybe partner with them?)
- Indicators on how the whole world influences one stock is a very, very complex, poorly defined and unstructured problem, and we will make no attempt to handle it.

In face of these obstacles, we will settle for a much-simplified, easily obtained and hopefully good-enough dataset: The daily summaries of US company's performance: Open, Close, Min and Max prices, and amount of transations.

This is large, well-known dataset, with several free sources. Initially, we will use [the one available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs), which despite being last-updated on November/2017, goes back several decades. We may switch for an updated dataset later on if it becomes available.

Unfortunately, the lack of real-time pricing will limit our prediction performance on day trading and short-term investments -- which would actually be the best possible scenario for an automatic trader, since a company's fundamentals, world economy, etc doesn't normally change within a day, even though people pay considerably different prices for a company within a day -- Often a 1-2% variation without anything special happening.
